# Houses of Calradia

_Houses of Calradia_ is a mod for [Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord](https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Bannerlord). Its primary purpose, along with most of my Bannerlord mods, is to promote sustainable multi-generational gameplay. It features primarily:

- A sophisticated matchmaking system for noble NPCs &mdash; the base game has zero AI marriage logic &mdash; which prioritizes marriages for clans that appear to be a survival risk whilst it significantly reduces the chances of a marriage for clans that are sufficiently entrenched (guards against overpopulation).
  - Matchmaking focus isn't entirely upon clan survivability: it considers politics, culture, age, personality, relations between the two clans' leaders, and relations between the suitor and maiden.
- Clan extinction prevention system that will find distant relatives to take over leadership if for some reason the proactive marriage system wasn't enough to prevent their last living adult member from dying.
- Optionally, use MCM (Mod Configuration Menu), and you'll get access to a powerful set of settings which you can edit in-game.

Much more information is available on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2174).
